# Contributing To Nemo-RL

Thanks for your interest in contributing to Nemo-RL!

## Setting Up

### Development Environment

1. **Build and run the Docker container**:
```bash
docker buildx build -t nemo-rl -f Dockerfile .
# Run the container with your local nemo-rl directory mounted
docker run -it --gpus all -v /path/to/nemo-rl:/workspace/nemo-rl nemo-rl
```

## Making Changes

### Workflow: Clone and Branch (No Fork Required)

#### Before You Start: Install pre-commit

From the [`nemo-rl` root directory](.), run:
```bash
python3 -m pip install pre-commit
pre-commit install
```

Pre-commit checks (using `ruff`) will help ensure your code follows our formatting and style guidelines.

We follow a direct clone and branch workflow for now:

1. Clone the repository directly:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/NVIDIA-NeMo/RL
   cd nemo-rl
   ```

2. Create a new branch for your changes:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b your-feature-name
   ```

3. Make your changes and commit them:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit --signoff -m "Your descriptive commit message"
   ```

We require signing commits with `--signoff` (or `-s` for short). See [Signing Your Work](#signing-your-work) for details.

4. Push your branch to the repository:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

5. Create a pull request from your branch to the `main` branch.

### Design Documentation Requirement

**Important**: All new key features (ex: enabling a new parallelization technique, enabling a new RL algorithm) must include documentation update (either a new doc or updating an existing one). This document update should:

- Explain the motivation and purpose of the feature
- Outline the technical approach and architecture
- Provide clear usage examples and instructions for users
- Document internal implementation details where appropriate

This ensures that all significant changes are well-thought-out and properly documented for future reference. Comprehensive documentation serves two critical purposes:

1. **User Adoption**: Helps users understand how to effectively use the library's features in their projects
2. **Developer Extensibility**: Enables developers to understand the internal architecture and implementation details, making it easier to modify, extend, or adapt the code for their specific use cases

Quality documentation is essential for both the usability of Nemo-RL and its ability to be customized by the community.

## Code Quality

- Follow the existing code style and conventions
- Write tests for new features
- Update documentation to reflect your changes
- Ensure all tests pass before submitting a PR
- Do not add arbitrary defaults for configs, be as explicit as possible.


## Signing Your Work

* We require that all contributors "sign-off" on their commits. This certifies that the contribution is your original work, or you have rights to submit it under the same license, or a compatible license.

  * Any contribution which contains commits that are not Signed-Off will not be accepted.

* To sign off on a commit you simply use the `--signoff` (or `-s`) option when committing your changes:
  ```bash
  $ git commit -s -m "Add cool feature."
  ```
  This will append the following to your commit message:
  ```
  Signed-off-by: Your Name <your@email.com>
  ```
